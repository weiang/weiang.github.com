My name is Ang Wei. Now I'm a third year undergraduate student at [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn). My major is computer science and technology.

# Research Interests
My research focuses on the development of artificial intelligence techniques and their application and integration in real world domains. I'm interested in building autonomous systems that interact with the world, systems capable of understanding the environment and making intelligent decisions. This interaction is feasible due to improvements in novel sensing, display, and actuation hardware as well as increased computational power. These factors provide machines with interfaces to observe the world, power to understand and reason, and mechanisms to respond. However, all these devices require the proper algorithms to connect them and grant a level of autonomy. My research centers on increasing the level of autonomy of systems by developing and applying machine learning, decision-making, and state-estimation and recognition techniques. Improved autonomy creates new potential applications, provides existing systems with additional capabilities, allows systems to perform duties humans could not perform otherwise, and reduces the burden on the user any time a direct interaction is required.

Here is my [CV](../pdf/AngWei-CV-rs.pdf).
