My name is Ang Wei. Now I'm a third year undergraduate student at *University of Science and Technology of China*. My major is computer science and thchnology. For the past three years, my undergraduate education has exposed me to various sub-fields of computer science. But most of my interests are in the field related to programming language and compiler design. It's very exciting to design a *good* programming language and implement an *effecient* compiler to relief programmers' work.

But what a good programming language is? Different people have different opinion.
